## Description

OVOS TTS plugin for [Mimic3](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mimic3)

* [Available voices](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mimic3-voices)
* [Documentation](https://mycroft-ai.gitbook.io/docs/mycroft-technologies/mimic-tts/coming-soon-mimic-3)


## Install

Install the necessary system packages:

``` sh
sudo apt-get install libespeak-ng1
```

On 32-bit ARM platforms (a.k.a. `armv7l` or `armhf`), you will also need some extra libraries:

``` sh
sudo apt-get install libatomic1 libgomp1 libatlas-base-dev
```

install the TTS plugin in Mycroft:

`pip install ovos-tts-plugin-mimic3[all]`

Removing `[all]` will install support for English only.

Additional language support can be selectively installed by replacing `all` with a two-character language code, such as `de` (German) or `fr` (French).
See [`setup.py`](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-tts-plugin-mimic3/blob/master/setup.py#L55) for an up-to-date list of language codes.
